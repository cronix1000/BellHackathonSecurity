> Take back your data.

## Empower users to control their data

Comb is a web protocol for access delegation. It enables users to **grant** and **revoke** their data that is used by websites they have signed up for.

When a website uses the Comb Protocol, they agree to store user data with us.
This puts data ownership in the user’s favour, and websites will agree to comply if they want to be seen as trustworthy.

## Obscure your identity

Obscure/hide your email and phone number using our forwarding service.
These types of information can easily be linked to your real identity. For example:

```
❌ John.Doe@gmail.com reveals your full name.
✅ truck.crayon.put451@combproxy.com is a random phrase which reveals nothing.
```

## For users

Use Comb next time your registering for a website!

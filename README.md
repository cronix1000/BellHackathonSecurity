# Comb - by Team Syntax Sorcerers

> Take back your data.

Comb is a web protocol for access delegation. It enables users to **grant** and **revoke** their data that is used by websites they have signed up for.

When a website uses the Comb Protocol, they agree to store user data with us.
This puts data ownership in the userâ€™s favour, and websites will agree to comply if they want to be seen as trustworthy.

## For users

You can use the "Log in with Comb account" button next to the other OAuth providers such as Google and Facebook.
